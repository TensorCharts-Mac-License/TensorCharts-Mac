## Overview

<a href="#">TensorCharts for macOS</a> is created for traders who interpret markets through the lens of structure, volume and pressure rather than simple candlesticks alone. It layers advanced visualizations—such as volume maps, pressure bars and structural overlays—on top of price to reveal where participation is concentrated. This makes it easier to distinguish between moves supported by real flow and those driven mainly by thin liquidity.

The platform organizes instruments into layouts that highlight key structural zones, including prior highs and lows, consolidation areas and breakout regions. Users can adjust sensitivity and aggregation to align with their time horizon, whether intraday rotations or multi-session swings. With <a href="#">custom overlay logic</a>, TensorCharts lets traders encode the types of behaviour they care about most into repeatable visual patterns.

On macOS, rendering performance and clarity are key priorities. Panning through history, zooming into specific moves and switching symbols are designed to remain fluid even with heavy overlays enabled. Colour schemes and contrast levels are tuned to keep important information visible without overwhelming the eyes. Over extended review and live-trading sessions, this improves comfort and helps preserve concentration.

TensorCharts fits naturally into a broader toolset that may include execution terminals, order-flow platforms and research dashboards. Its role is to provide structural context: where value has formed, where reactions have clustered and where new initiative behaviour is showing up. For macOS users who want to level up their chart reading beyond generic setups, it offers a specialised, interpretation-focused perspective on market movement.
